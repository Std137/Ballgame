VelesStudio Training Project
Pilot project for studying programming issues implemented
in Python. 
The project was implemented by adding functionality to each new version of the program. This approach allows you to develop the student's thinking in terms of finding solutions and integrating them into the current version of the application. Teaches you how to step-by-step debugging an application, testing the interaction of new functions and finding bugs. In parallel, the student works out the skills of working with versions, learns the pattern of clean code, commenting on functionality, and generating logical names for structure variables.
